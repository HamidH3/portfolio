                            <h3>Minuteman Press Uxbridge, Print Operator/ Graphic Design/ Brand Awareness </h3>
                            <li>From adjusting printer settings to troubleshooting technical issues, I have developed strong, effective problem-solving skills. </li>
                            <li>As part of the graphic design process, I was in charge of producing logos for potential clients to engage them with their unique brand identity and vision. This experience enabled me to contribute to the formulation of effective branding strategies while also learning about the management of client relationships.</li>
                            <li>In my role, I significantly enhanced the company's brand awareness through the creation and distribution of marketing collateral, including flyers, postcards, business cards, and brochures. This strategic effort, targeting nearby stores, effectively conveyed the value of our promotional materials to other business owners, resulting in increased foot traffic and revenue for Minuteman Press</li>
